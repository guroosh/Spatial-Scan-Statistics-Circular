TODO:

Lower and Upper bound in Moving circle.

Monte Carlo simulation

Multiple datasets

Make functions for: 
	finding overlapping area of 2 circles
	computing p-value 
	Inverse jacards index
	

in Circle Ops: remove scanCircle from checkAnglePoints, instead store points only once guroosh
in Circle Ops: complete implementation of points found in checkQuad points
in Naive: change controller function names to shift in x and shift in y
