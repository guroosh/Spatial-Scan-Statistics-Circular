TODO:

Monte Carlo simulation

one more city

Make functions for: 
	finding overlapping area of 2 circles
	computing p-value 
	Inverse jacards index
	

in Circle Ops: remove scanCircle from checkAnglePoints, instead store points only once guroosh
in Circle Ops: complete implementation of points found in checkQuad points
in Naive: change controller function names to shift in x and shift in y


remove scanCircle from one more place: from moving circles when removing all points after adding final circle


Runtime of a moving circle with proper visualization

FUTURE SUGGESTIONS:

read spread of the data to get the growht_drtate
