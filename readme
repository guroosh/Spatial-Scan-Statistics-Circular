How to run:
Run ./script.sh for the code
You can modify the Values in TestingAlgo.Values to see its effect on code.

Code logic:
Code starts from main,initially a dataset is taken as string input,the dataset has to be in the project folder.Note that the dataset has to be of format (x,y) in degree
or input columns in TestingAlgo.Values

A Gridfile is constructed from the dataset and is used as an parameter,you get 8 options to run on the dataset, 4 frameworks of 2 algorithms
To run whichever framework individually,check below :

Naive Serial Version : runNaiveTester(gridFile, events);
Naive Habenero Java Version : runNaiveTesterHJ(gridFile, events);
Naive Fork Join Pool Version : runNaiveTesterFJP(gridFile, events);
Naive Java Open-MP Version : runNaiveTesterJOMP(gridFile, events);
Moving Circle Serial Version : runMovingCircleTester(gridFile, events);
Moving Circle Habenero Java Version : runMovingCircleTesterHJ(gridFile, events);
Moving Circle Java Fork Join Pool Version : runMovingCircleTesterJvFP(gridFile, events);
Moving Circle Java Open-MP Version : runMovingCircleTesterJOMP(gridFile, events);

To run the above you need to provide a gridfile of the dataset and events from the dataset,to construct the two,look below

Events:
filename is a string
ArrayList<Events> events = readDataFile(fileName);

Values of minlat maxlat minlon and maxlon can be 360,-360,360,-360
Gridfile
GridFile gridFile = new GridFile();
GridCell gridCell = new GridCell(gridFile, minLat, maxLat, minLon, maxLon);
gridCell = gridCell.getGridCell(gridFile);
gridFile.make(events, gridCell);


Apart from the standalone functions,there are several experiments designed which can also be of use for analysis,details are given below
Comparing all frameworks of Naive : exp1_phase1(gridFile, events)
Comparing all frameworks of Naive(Monte Carlo) : exp1_phase2(events.size(), area)
Comparing all frameworks of Moving Circle : exp2_phase1(gridFile, events)
Comparing all frameworks of Moving Circle : exp2_phase1(gridFile, events)
Comparing all frameworks of Moving Circle(Monte Carlo) : exp2_phase2(events.size(), area)
Comparing run-times with varying growth rates : exp3(gridFile, events)


For printing top circles or the visual representation you need to follow these steps:
In both algorithm top n circles are printed and visualized.
The values can be changed in TestingAlgo/Values.java, where the parameters are 'top_circles_for_visualize' and 'top_circles_for_print'
To avoid the window popup for visualize (in case the value is zero) comment the following lines:
line number 282 in Naive/Naive.java 'vis.drawCircles(events, core_circles, "Naive");' inside the function afterNaive()
line number 350 in Moving_Circle/MovingCircle.java 'vis.drawCircles(events, moving_circles_for_visualize, "Moving circle");' inside the function visualizedata()
